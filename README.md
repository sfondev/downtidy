# downtidy

[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

Just a stupid Python script to sort my downloads folder based on file extensions.
Tried to use only the Python std library.

OBS:It should work, but it needs more testing (Not responsible for any files lost to the void ðŸ˜…).

black formatter settings: default
## TODO

    + Comment the code more
    + Maybe add reading config from JSON or similar
    + Maybe add progressbars (probably unnecessary)
    + Maybe add color to the error messages and to the fail to tidy 
    + Fix bugs or improve performance where needed
    + Maybe Add "--folder" that allows the folder to tidy to be given as an argument
